# Libraries
'''
Python libraries are sets of code that provide predefined code structures, allowing us to avoid coding from scratch.
'''

# Lists
'''
Lists in Python are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Example: food = ["pizza", "carrots", "eggs"]
'''

# Function Arguments
'''
Function arguments in Python are values passed to the function within parentheses. 
In Python, arguments are passed by "object reference," which means that mutable objects 
(like lists or dictionaries) can be modified within the function, while immutable objects 
(like integers, strings, or tuples) cannot affect the original value.
